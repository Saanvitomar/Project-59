      <p>Hello, My name is Saanvi tomar I study in class 6th. My favourite hobby is swiming because, Swimming as a hobby is surely one of the best. It exercises our whole body. People who swim regularly need not fear cardiac disorders or diabetes or arthritis- all the diseases that have crippled mankind these days. For children who swim, it ensures that their limbs grow properly and they also gain height. I love swimming because it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed. On the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat.

      <h1>My Favourite Stroke</h1>
      <div class="line">
        <p>My favourite stroke is freestroke because freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of the International Swimming Federation (FINA), in which competitors are subject to few limited restrictions[1] on their swimming stroke. Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions, with distances beginning with 50 meters (50 yards) and reaching 1500 meters (1650 yards),[2] also known as the mile. The term 'freestyle stroke' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl',[3] as front crawl is the fastest swimming stroke. It is now the most common stroke used in freestyle competitions.Freestyle is the fastest of all the strokes, so as you might expect it is up in second place for calorie burning potential. Swimming freestyle tones your stomach, buttocks and shoulders. Out of all the four strokes freestyle is said to have the greatest impact on toning back muscles.
